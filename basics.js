// JavaScript basic terms/concepts

// Object: A JavaScript object is a data structure that stores a collection of properties (see line 35). Examples:

    // Variable:
    const car = 'Volkswagen'

    // Object (a variable with multiple key:value pairs):
    const carInfo = {
        make: "Volkswagen",
        model: "Polo",
        colour: "Black",
        seats: 5
    };

    // Array (variable that can hold more than one value):
    const carArray = ["Volkswagen", "BMW", "Porsche"]

    // Array of objects:
    const carsArray = [
        {
            make: "BMW",
            model: "4 Series",
            colour: "Grey",
            seats: 4
        },
        {
            make: "Porsche",
            model: "911",
            colour: "Silver",
            seats: 2
        }
    ];

// Property: A member of an object that associates a key with a value. Example: 
// The object carInfo above has four properties. The first property has "make" as the key and "Volkswagen" as the value.

// Method: a function which is a property of an object. Two kinds: instance methods which are built-in tasks performed by an object instance,
// and static methods which are tasks that are called directly on an object constructor. Examples:
